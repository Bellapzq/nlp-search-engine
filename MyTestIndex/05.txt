Language is dynamic, evolving alongside humanity. Words that once had specific 
meanings are now used in completely different contexts. For instance, the word 
"awful" once meant "full of awe," and "nice" meant "ignorant" in the Middle 
Ages. As societies changed, so did the language, adapting to new cultural and 
social environments. The invention of the internet has accelerated this change, 
introducing abbreviations like "lol" and "brb" into everyday language. Isn't it 
intriguing how our words evolve?
