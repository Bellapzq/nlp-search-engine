Mental health is just as crucial as physical health, yet it has often been 
stigmatized. In recent years, however, society has become more open to discussing 
mental health issues. Conditions like anxiety, depression, and PTSD are now 
understood better, and treatment options have significantly improved. 
According to Dr. J., a psychiatrist, "Seeking help isn’t a sign of weakness; 
it’s a step towards healing." Support systems, such as therapy and support 
groups, are becoming more accessible. It’s okay to seek help, isn't it?
