Medical science has advanced rapidly, especially in the last century. From the 
discovery of antibiotics to modern robotic surgeries, these advancements have 
extended life expectancy and improved quality of life. We are now entering a 
phase where personalized medicine is becoming more common, allowing treatments 
to be tailored to an individual's genetic makeup. Dr. Evan Ross, a pioneer in 
robotic surgery, says, "The future of medicine lies in innovation." It’s 
remarkable to think about the possibilities, wouldn’t you agree?
